# Smart Weather Tab Chrome Extension

## About

Smart Weather Tab is a Google Chrome extension that displays the weather in a beautiful way in the new tab window. It is written in vanilla JS.
The user can either enter a city or use the current location to display the latest weather data.
Data shown includes the current situation, highlights of today, as well as a 5-day weather forecast.

Different settings for interface or units let you personalize the application.
Depending on the weather condition, changing background images are displayed.
For each day in the 5-day list details can be displayed by clicking it.

Weather data is provided by [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com).
Reverse geocoding is provided by [BigDataCloud API](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/).
